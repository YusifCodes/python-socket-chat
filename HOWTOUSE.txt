Welcome to my simple python chat app.
*
*
*
To use it, first of all you have to run the server.py file. 
After that the server will turn on, and start listening for connections.
*
*
*
When the server is turned on, you can proceed to running the actual client (client.py).
Every instance of cmd/terminal is considered a new client.
It is recommended to only run two clients at the same time (The server will start ignoring client instances after there are two clients already).
*
*
*
If you want to exit just close the instance of the server.

Enjoy,
